** Deployment Notes **

First, you must have the Google Cloud SDK installed. See http://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/.

Next, do "gcloud config list" and make sure the project ID listed in the output is the project
ID that you want to deploy to. If not, set it with "gcloud config set project <your project ID>".

Then, all you have to do is execute "gcloud app deploy" and wait for it to finish.
Don't deploy anything with out making sure it works locally (see the README).
Also, you should probably let everyone know somehow that you are deploying a new version.

I'm not sure if there will be an authentication issue. If there is, contact me (Audric).
