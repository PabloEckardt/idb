          <p> There is a need to have an easy to use, centralized, and informative website for restaurants in the immediate area. There are currently certain sites that do provide a certain amount of these qualities but they are too broad in scope and not specific to the needs of every city. The goal of FoodCloseToMe is to have a website that will make the user feel like it was built for them and their city.  </p>

          <p>A use case would be for someone interested in learning about the different type of foods and areas in their city. Let’s say a user wants to know how Italian food fares in their city, they can go to FoodCloseTo.me and check out the food types. They can then click on Italian and it will show the best rated restaurant in their area and where this restaurant is located. This now gives the user a means to check out the different food types and see where they can go to get the best of the best in their respective cities. Other means of finding this information could be by area first instead of food type.</p>

          <h2>Aesthetics:</h2><br>
            <p>Our website started with a very very basic aesthetic, a simple white background and and some nice pictures that were labeled for free use. For Phase 2 we decided to improve
                our general design, and give our website a personality. This was a little challenging since we all fanatics of minimalistic designs. So even adding colors was not our first instinct.
                We decided to use red for our navigation bar because its a color very much associated with food in advertising. but instead of going for a stringent red such as yelp's we went for a more pastel type
                of red. Then we supplemented it with another pastel color for our background, a simple aqua marine. The result is a very pleasing yet simple website that carries a consistent style throughout.
                We improved our imagery and fonts, and with those simple changes our website looks a lot more professional. For the sake of consistency we choose aspect ratio over image size as far as how we display
                our instances. For that reason sometimes images will appear to be slightly smaller, but never distorted. Overall we aspired for polished simplicity.

          </ol>
          <h2>Front End:</h2><br>
          <p>The front end was designed using a basic bootstrap enabled theme and Flask. Flask templates were used to render each page with “layout.html” template as the base template. All the templates used by Flask are found within the “app/template” folder. These templates use Flask syntax to help populate the pages, especially when dealing with the grids found on each main model page. The grid is filled in depending on the size of the passed data, which it will iterated through and display each instance on the page. Each page will have a navbar at the top to allow users to easily navigate to the different areas of the site. Aside from the navbar each page will have a different template used to show the content. “app/template/layout.html” inside the “app/template” folder will be the main layout of the website. Each other template will be extending “app/template/layout.html” and including a block named “body” to render that page properly through the rendering function for each view in “app/views.py”.</p>
          <p>The majority of the CSS is managed by the bootstrap included css but for the rest of the designs, the CSS is in “static/style.css”. The CSS found in this file will be a little more specific to the needs of the website and pages, such as certain CSS classes found in the about.html or restaurants.html web pages.</p>
          <p>The instance pages are pages that will hold more details about a specific restaurant, location, or food type. The middle column within each instance page will have information such as: Best Restaurant, Reviews, Name of Restaurant, Hours of Operation, Price, Popular Food Type, or Cheapest Restaurant. On the left hand side (right hand side for the restaurants instance page) there will be links that the user will be able to click that will send them to a restaurant or location.</p>
            <p><strong>React:</strong><br>
            We are using React in our website to help with the population of the Grid system and for the AJAX calls to the API for sorting and
            filtering. That being said, React does not do any actual filtering or sorting (apart from reversing the results if Rating Low to High
            or Rating High to Low is selected). We are not housing any of the react node modules within our servers, but instead relying on CDN
            links to activate React within our website. Each "template" (i.e. Restaurants, Locations, Food Types, and Reviews) has their own
            React file that populates the grid with corresponding information that is pulled from the database using an AJAX call. This AJAX call
            is using the API urls that were created in "app/views.py".</p>
            <p>The main React components are RestList, RestItem, FoodTypeList, FoodTypeItem, LocationList, LocationItem, ReviewList, ReviewItem. Each
            List component has many Items, depending on the number of instances of that model within the database. Before the components are rendered,
            the query to the database is done to see how many elements will be returned. At this point we will know just how many elements we will
            need to display and how many pages we will need (depending on the number of elements per page). Within the ajax call (since it is async) we
            will be creating the pages data structure which each index of that array will have X number of elements. When rendering the pages, since
            the initial render will be page 1, we send pages[0] to be rendered which has 45 elements (or less if there weren't 45 returned elements).
            For pagination, if a user clicks on Next, Last, Prev, or First, the page index will be either increased or decreased and then the
            grid div will be re-rendered using the new page[pageIndex]. This drastically speeds up rendering speed of the React components. Initially
            we were rendering all 4k restaurants and it was taking approximately 8 seconds to render. After this implementation it was reduced to about
            1 sec.</p>
            <p><strong>Search Functionality on the Front End:</strong><br>
                For the front end portion of the search functionality, the search parameter is passed to the page through the URL, with the URL being
                "/All?search=parameters". The API call for searching is "/API/All?search=parameters", which a JSON is returned with an array of 8
                dictionaries, first 4 are high priority (better matching) and lower priority are the latter 4. <br>The reason for the different dictionaries
                is to be able to distinguish which model each entry came from and to know where to link them to, for instance, linking a restaurant
                to "/Restaurant/ID" or a review to "Reviews/ID". Within the AllList React component, we are checking each attribute of the model
                to see if the searched keywords are found, and if found it is highlighted. We gather the search keywords by getting the URL
                parameters through function called "getParameterByName" which takes in the URL and a parameter name, in this case "search".<br> For
                each item that will generate a React component, we call "updateHaystack" which takes in the attribute field and performs a REGEX
                match and replace to put the keywords found in a span that will be highlighted due to the CSS associated to the id of that span. We
                used the same pagination functionality as the other models/pages and we also included which model each search result is coming
                from on the top right of the div to inform the user which model the search is from.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>Search Functionality on the Back End </strong><br>

                The search functionality in the back end is a 3 step process in which we query the whole database for all matching attributes of all models.
                We determined that the most important parameters in a search may be implicit within the search, or they may be the exact relative match
                of the search.  simple "or" of the terms in the database is not good enough for our
                kind of models. There would be too much noise in the results because of our 12k review data points, which by nature contain words that describe
                our models such as names, food types, locations, etc.

                Note that our search is capable of correcting simple errors in capitalization, locate elements contained in other strings, and a combination of both.

                We identified 3 main multi-word search cases and built a solution for each one of them.

                <ol type="1">
                    <li> <strong>High Priority </strong> <br></li>
                        First is the basic case and potentially most important one
                        where we assume that the user gave us a set of words which are to be interpreted as a single string. Such as complete name of a restaurant
                        like "Taco Bell". When somebody searches for Taco Bell they don't expect a search result derived from adding the meaning of each individual word.
                        So we catalog these results as highest priority, and results such as these are always among the first to come up in the search results.
                    <li> <strong>Low Priority </strong> <br></li>
                        The second case is when a user searches for a series of individual ideas i.e: Mexican Tacos. In this case we can assume that yielding result from
                        searching each individual meaning is acceptable for the user. We consider these searches the lowest priority searches and its results are
                        displayed last.<br>
                    <li> <strong>Mid Priority </strong> <br></li>
                        The third and most complex case is a mixture of the last two. When there are groupings of words that together are highly relevant and are accompanied
                        by words that exist to narrow or supplement the search results. I.e. Cabob Bob's Burritos 78704. This kind of search is complicated and not solved by
                        the cases described above. We can't make any assumption for this case as to what is what in a list of search parameters.<br>

                        On one hand, the first solution we implemented would yield 0 results, and on the other hand the second solution would yield far too many and
                        disorganized results for the search to be meaningful.<br><br> For this reason we wrote an algorithm that would generate unique contigous groupings
                        (> 1 elements) from a set of words. We used those groupings and treated them as search parameters for case 1, thus yielding our middle priority results.
                        The results of these 3 methods put together yield a strong search engine that is very error resistant, and almost fully context aware.<br>

                        In our search engine, it is possible to make incorrect assertions while making a search and do searches such as: Cabob Bob's Tacos, and still get the
                        correct result parameters displayed first. Additionally, our search is fast and demonstrates no latency whatsoever while it searches over our thousands
                        of instances.<br>
                </ol>
                Our last adjustments were to make decisions as to which models should we be displaying first within each category high or low priority.
                We ended up with a model where Restaurants > Food_Types > Locations > Reviews was the norm. Reviews are too plentiful and return for almost any search
                concerning each one of the other models. However, if a user would search for a reviewer's user name its guaranteed it would be displayed first.
                For that reason they are set to last.<br> Since the core of our website is restaurants, and our middle and high priority searches do an excellent job
                at finding these, we put that first. Food_Types is a better abstraction that Locations because information about a type of food is more concrete on a
                base level than information about a zipcode.

            </p>
          <h2>Back End:</h2> <br>
          <p>At this point of the development of foodcloseto.me we have 4 models:  Reviews,  Food_Types,  Locations, Restaurants. </p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Restaurants:</strong> Restaurants instances are the heart and soul of our application. They provide the most useful information for users and they will receive the most attention and tailoring. The restaurant table works with a Primary-Surrogate  key  for simplicity but it will probably be optimized to a composite key using addresses and restaurant names. Restaurants will link to the Food_Types table and the Reviews table. And are the most linked-to model with a total of 3 other tables linking to Restaurants. We consider all attributes to this model to be essential so they are non-nullable. For the foreseeable future until we can better gauge the capabilities of the Yelp and Google Business API. Restaurants can be easily sorted or filtered by design by parameters such as price and rating.
          </li>
          <li>
          <strong>Locations:</strong>  Locations instances represent Zipcodes. These naturally keyed elements have interesting meta-data relating food in enclosed areas. For example: average_health_rating attribute, is a parameter that averages the health ratings of several establishments via public records to give a general idea of what an eating experience could be at a given area. That information coupled with averaged prices of the area can give a user a general idea if he even wants to visit the area.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Food Types:</strong> This is another meta-data oriented model similar to Locations. In this case users can see how a food type such as: “Italian”, or “American” performs as far as ratings (user experience) and price. The motivation for this model is for users to start getting general ideas in their search for a restaurant. </li>
          <li><strong>Reviews:</strong> Our Reviews model is designed for when the user already has an idea of a selected handful of restaurants he wants to visit, and may user other direct user experiences to make a final selection. Among its attributes there is brief information about the reviewer and information about the review itself such as the date. It connects to Restaurants, and Locations. </li>

          <h2> Documentation </h2><br>
          <p>The API is documented using Apiary, a json-based API Documentation tool. The Apiary page for the project can be found at http://docs.foodclosetome.apiary.io. The documentation gives a description of each method of the API, detailing the path of the method, the needed variables for each method (if any), and what will be returned by each method. The documentation is divided into groups, each of which contains different paths, each of which contains methods that are called using these paths, showing a sample of what response a user would expect when calling these methods.</p>
  
          <h2> Development </h2><br>
          <p>The source code for this project can be found on GitHub at <a href = "https://github.com/PabloEckardt/idb">https://github.com/PabloEckardt/idb</a>. GitHub is an application that stores files and allows for branching and version control, as well as continuous integration (see below). In addition, issues are added and updated using the issue tracker. Currently, there is a main branch (master), a branch for creating the database (db), and a branch to fix template issues (badTemplate).</p>
          <p>Continuous integration was done with Travis CI. Travis CI is an application that connects to a GitHub repo and runs a simulation on it every time a push is made, documenting whether it succeeded or failed. The instructions that Travis CI follows, before and during execution of project code, can be seen and edited in .travis.yml. Currently, the system is setup to run Pydoc on models.py, and check for necessary files. The system will also be setup to run the tests located in app/tests.py, ensuring that our API returns the expected results on particular requests.</p>
          <p>The makefile is a file that builds several files by running a series of commands. To test the data for the presence of files and the functionality of the programs, simply run ‘make test’ (which is also the process run by Travis CI).</p>
          <h2> Front End </h2><br>
          <p> Bootstrap was used for the overall design of the website. The basic theme was used to produce the final product. A carousel is displayed on the splash screen that was also made using bootstrap. </p>
            <p>React was used for dynamic content and filtering/sorting process on the website.</p>
          <h2> Back End </h2><br>
          <p><strong>SQLAlchemy</strong><br> Our database is completely implemented on SQLAlchemy, which for simplicity let's say it works as a wrapper around SQL. So rather than having to write SQL commands inside python within exec() statements. SQLAlchemy allows us to take a more Object Oriented Programming approach to database management. SQLAlchemy has Database migration, downgrading and other management tools which have not been implemented for this project but will be available in the next phases.</p>
          <p>For instance we intend to use this Object Oriented approach by having objects like session_tokens which are generated by our function init_session(). Those tokens can be used to orderly commit changes to the database, since in the future we will implement restrictions on the creation of session_tokens objects. This intended use may help with future synchronization issues between users querying from our API, or accessing the website and us doing database changes.</p>
          <p>In addition to the OOP philosophy embedded into SQLAlchemy, it also allows us to build our own wrappers over the already relatively simple functionalities. In this case, our file insert_records.py has wrappers to insert and commit changes to session_tokens. This is purely for simplicity, maintainability and readability of future users.</p>
          <p><strong>Flask</strong><br> Flask is what we are using as the spirit of our backend. It is the framework of our application and we use it consistently to render templates. Flask was important for the early development stages before the deployment of our website for several reasons. First it allowed us to preview and interact with our website before it was deployed using Google Cloud Platform. Running our Flask app would is enough to run our website locally using localHost:5000/. A functionality that is still useful to test changes before deploying them in a more realistic scenario.</p>
          <p>Secondly, it was very easy to start the project in several machines because Flask works on a Python Virtual Environment. Which means that any user can download our repo from github, activate the virtual environment and run the application since all package dependencies will be contained in the virtual environment. </p>
          <p>In addition to the to those key features I described above. Flask is the Engine that renders our templates. Meaning HTML elements, and python logic common throughout different pages; such as the navigation bar, do not need to be re-implemented across different files. Templates are crucial at eliminating code duplication and building a maintainable code base. If we ever need to change parameters for the grid  in our project. We don’t need to do that for every Model we have designed, or future models we make. We can just modify the template grid.html. Which contains the logic that will be applied through any view that renders the template.</p>
          <p>Flask Views, are another feature of flask similar to templates in spirit.
          Views allow us to statically or dynamically handle URLs. A view exists in the form of a python function with a decorator. The function renders the template, and the decorator specifies the url in the website to be rendered with the template. The reason why this is important is that ideally the database will be periodically updated adding new elements to the website. Without Views and templates every time we would add an instance of any of our models we would have to manually add the URLs and HTML pages to make them accessible. But since we do have these tools, for example: Every restaurant added to the database with a surrogate key 0 - N, can be automatically rendered by simply accessing foodcloseto.ne/Restaurants/ <0-N>. This guarantees the scalability of our internet database.</p>

          <p><strong>Google Cloud Platforms:</strong><br> We decided to host our website on Google Cloud Platforms (GCP). The reason we chose GCP over Amazon Web Services (AWS) is because we felt like GCP is current and relevant. We also feel like it will simply be a matter of time before GCP overtakes AWS and become the leading Cloud Hosting Platform. The remaining portion of this section will mostly consist of setup/management details of our GCP server and possibly some further motivation behind our decisions.</p>
          <p><strong>App Engine:</strong><br> GCP’s App Engine is essentially one or more servers that are connected and have a high level of configurability. The engine consists of versions and instances. The versions, which are created upon each push or deployment to the App Engine, represent this version of the service. An incredible feature of GCP is that it will keep track of all your versions to provide a sense of version control for your product or service. Versions must be deleted manually. The instances are essentially how GCP scales your service, either manually or dynamically. The more traffic your service receives, the more instances GCP will deploy of that particular version. The opposite is also true.</p>
          <p><strong>app.yaml:</strong> This file is responsible for configuring the actual Google App Engine (aka the server) that hosts our website. The .yml extension is short for YAML and is a basic human-readable serialization format. If you direct your attention to the app.yaml file that we have in our repository, you’ll notice that there are only a few lines. I’ll walk through each line in and explain what is happening starting on line 5:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            <p>runtime: python - this line tells the App Engine the main runtime environment used in the application. This field is required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>env: flex - This specifies that we want our environment to be handled automatically by GCP. This includes scaling and load balancing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app - This specifies where we want the WSGI server to enter our application. Gunicorn is the server and the rest of the line are arguments specifying the port and file. Although I won’t go into it here, WSGI servers (along with GCP’s nice design) are the reason a setup this simple sufficient; one of the major reasons we used GCP.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>runtime_config: This is just a key denoting a new configuration section.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>python_version: 3 - The python version we want to the server to run in.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>config.py:</strong> This is the last configuration file. It doesn’t exactly interact with GCP directly, but, rather, interacts with it indirectly. Essentially, that file contains the GCP Project ID which then goes in our main Flask object. This Project ID is how the local version of the Google Cloud SDK authenticates the user when utilizing their provided command line interface (CLI).  This CLI is what we use to deploy our application to the App Engine and is by far the easiest way to do so.</p>

            <h1 id = "Data Visualization">Data Visualization With D3</h1><br>
        </div>
        <p>
            We were assigned the task of performing some kind of data visualization using another groups API. The main tool that we used to achieve this goal was the D3 javascript library. D3 is extremely powerful and useful and really makes it easy to bring data to life via a mixture of HTML, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), and CSS, all combined into one easy to import module. The data visualization that we exercised using this library is very simple and straightforward and doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of what D3 is capable of. Now, after that intentionally long introduction, let’s get into the details. <br><br>
            We started by choosing a simple example from D3’s main website, as we were told this was ok to do. The example we chose was slightly interactive and animated bubble chart. The group that we were assigned to visualize data from was Code Artists (artistree.me). Their main API categories were Artists, Works, Media, and Eras. Given that we were doing a bubble chart, we thought it would make the most sense to tally up the number of works per Era and display total counts per era as the bubbles. So for example, the 17 Century (an “Era”) had 1214 pieces of artwork, which represents one bubble in our chart. Clearly, this is a really simple idea that D3 made trivial almost. Regardless, the actual code is explained below. <br><br>
            First, the file I’ll be explaining is in app/templates/data_visualization.html. The first necessary step is to import the necessary libraries (D3, along with some supporting functionalities from the example). Next, we need to query Code Artist’s API and get the actual data. Part of the project requirement was to do this dynamically instead of downloading the data into a static file, so that’s what we did. The only issues with this is that the raw returned json from their API wasn’t exactly in the right format that we needed for the D3 method that we were planning on using. Therefore, there was a little data massaging necessary. Starting on line 19 of the file, which is in javascript, what we did was query the API for all artworks, (note: everything after the d3.json() query is inside of the callback parameter to that function. If you don’t know what a callback is, a simple Google search will suffice), and then loop through the returned json by object, where each object represents another json of a specific artwork. For each artwork we cracked the Century (or Era) from the data field and added it to a different json that we were building that stored the counts of each artwork by era. So, if the current iterations date was the first of an Era, we would add a new field to our json. Otherwise, we increment the count for that Era by one. Once this new json with all the counts was created, we simply looped through it to form one more new json that fit the format of what the D3 method we were going to use required. The last thing necessary to complete this visualization is to build the actual chart. All this requires is a call to d3.svg.BubbleChart(). This method takes quite a few parameters, but they are all pretty straightforward. They specify things like the data, what colors to use, how big to make the circles, whether or not to make the bubbles interactive or not, and things like that. After this call is finished, the only thing left is a little html styling which is handled at the very bottom of the file. And that’s it! After those few simple steps, the data visualization is complete.
