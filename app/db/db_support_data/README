How to quickly filter more restaurants out of the list:
>python restaurants_cleaner.py; python restaurants_to_locations; python restaurants_to_food_types.py

add or remove elements from filtered_from_categories.txt

note: if you are going to do this. Remember to then run restaurant_reviews_equalizer.py
in order to make the a restaurants json that does not have anymore
restaurants than the ones reviews.

see:
-filtered_from_restaurants.txt // for details on restaurants deleted.
-the outoput of restaurants_to_food_types.py to see number of restaurants per category.

list of files we care about:

   slimmed down restuarants_with_filtered_categories.json which doesn't have the 83 reviews the api failed to get
   the result is now restaurants.json

   Main files:
   1) restaurants.json

   2) locations.json

   3) food_types.json

   4) reviews.json
