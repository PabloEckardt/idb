# To Run The App Localy
Execute the following commands (you must be in the top-level of this repo):
- ". ./gen_venv.sh" (this creates a virtualenv with the necessary requirements)
- "python run.py" (this runs the application)

Then, copy the "http:"... link in the first line of output and paste it into your browser.

When you are ready to quit the process, execute the following commands:
- CTRL-C (to quit the process)
- "deactivate" (to exit the virtualenv)

Once you have executed the ". ./gen_venv.sh" command and created the virtualenv for the first
time, you can just enter it from now on by executing "source venv/bin/activate" and then run
the app with "python run.py". However, re-executing ". ./gen_venv.sh" and then "python run.py"
will still work.
